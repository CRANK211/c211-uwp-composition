# Read Me #

The overall purpose of this repo is to create a central location for us to share our Composition explorations.

This initial load has the code that supports a sample we put together that demos how you can use Implicit Animations to improve the appearance when resize/re-layout of an application occurs based upon snap-point visual triggers.
